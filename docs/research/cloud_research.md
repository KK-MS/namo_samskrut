# Cloud research

Research questions:

1. Why do we need cloud vs non-cloud?

2. When do we need it? Phase-1 or Phase-2.

3. Research on the different clouds
  
    * Option 1 (Worst):
      * AWS offers a variety of tools, but it has a price tag.

    * Option 2:
      * Freenom is a great tool, to get DNS, it can be powerfull with Infinityfree hosting, but it only has 12 Months of free domains

    * Option 3:
      * Infinityfree hosting on it's own provides DNS Names, but it only provides free domains containing '.infinityfreeaps.com' as subdomain and only supports PHP
    
    * Option 4 (Best):
      * A Combination of Option 3 and pythonanywhere free tier is Good, since we can run the Website, for free and have the python api's on the other server, but pythonanywhere only gives 512 MB For free. But for that it is easy to deploy
      
    * Option 5 (Best):
      * A Combination of Option 3 and Heroku free tier is Good, since we can run the Website, for free and have the python api's on the other server. The Provided Free 1GB Is enough for the API. The only Con is it is hard to deploy
      

    Sample websites created during the research:
      * (Fairly new site, if not available, refresh the dns cache): http://www.namosanskrut-testpage.infinityfreeapp.com/ 
      * (Lasts only for 12 Months): http://www.namosanskrut-testpage.ml   
      * (Pythonanywhere API Sample site): http://coolninja20104.pythonanywhere.com
