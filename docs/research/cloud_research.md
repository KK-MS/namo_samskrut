# Cloud research

Research questions:

1. Why do we need cloud vs non-cloud?

2. When do we need it? Phase-1 or Phase-2.

3. Research on the different clouds
  
  * Option 1:
    * AWS offers a variety of tools, but it has a price tag.
  
  * Option 2:
    * Freenom is a great tool, to get DNS, it can be powerfull with Infinityfree hosting, but it only has 12 Months of free domains
   
  * Option 3 (Best):
    * Infinityfree hosting on it's own provides DNS Names, but it only provides free domains containing '.infinityfreeaps.com' as subdomain
  
  Sample websites created during the research:
    http://namosanskrut-testpage.infinityfreeapp.com/ (Fairly new site, if not available, refresh the dns cache)
